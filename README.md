Yooo guys wht u gotta do is basically download the file open chrome://extensions/ turn on your developer mode on the right top side then click load unpacked then load this file next time u open roblox on the web u can find 2 buttons at the blox fruits page Find saddi,Find shisui and etc.

Note:The code will not give you the location of the dealer but it will be on one of the leaves at the green zone
T
o understand wht it does is:

I have inputted multiple discord webhooks from different channels of blox fruits then i used replit to code an ai bot to go through messages and then get usernames which are verified on the servers and lets you join them which has the said thing you r looking for.

Please contact me on discord blazerdude#4918 for any bugs

The code has multiple other uses such as finding mirage, finding aura colour and etc. you can use it as well if you like

THank you!
